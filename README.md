Getting this working on cloud9 http://c9.io and with php support so that it can be done from a web page

Setup by making a blank workspace and running the setup.sh bash file.

Install this github 



https://github.com/hpssjellis/char-rnn-tensorflow-music-3dprinting.git

as a blank or php workspace

in s terminal right click --> run the index.php file

Open the link provided in the terminal output

# Requirements
- [Tensorflow](http://www.tensorflow.org)

# Basic Usage
To train with default parameters on the tinyshakespeare corpus, run `python train.py`.

To sample from a checkpointed model, `python sample.py`.
# Roadmap
- Add explanatory comments
- Expose more command-line arguments
- Compare accuracy and performance with char-rnn
